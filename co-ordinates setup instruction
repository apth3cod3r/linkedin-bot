In this bot i have used default co-ordinates of several buttons which may differ in you system, So here's how you can change them in you system easily

go to python shell (or IDLE)
type following :-

>>> import pyautogui
>>> pyautogui.mouseInfo()

A gui based program will open  which cleary gives the dynamic information about the cursor's position,
take the cursor to the desired positon and you will get the co-ordinates of that position .
Note them down.

if you get error while using pyautogui them do the following
-go to command prompt
-type python -m pip install pyautogui
